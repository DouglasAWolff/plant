python-dotenv
-------------

To install the `python-dotenv` package without an internet connection, you can follow these steps:

1. On a computer with an internet connection, visit the Python Package Index (PyPI) website and search for the `python-dotenv` package. You can find it at this URL: https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/

2. Download the source distribution (`.tar.gz` file) or the wheel distribution (`.whl` file) of the `python-dotenv` package. Make sure to download the version compatible with your Python installation and operating system.

3. Save the downloaded file to a USB stick or external storage device.

4. Transfer the USB stick to the computer without an internet connection.

5. On the computer without an internet connection, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the `python-dotenv` distribution file.

6. Install the package using the appropriate command based on the file type you downloaded:

   - If you downloaded a source distribution (`.tar.gz` file), run the following command:
     ```
     pip install <filename>.tar.gz
     ```

   - If you downloaded a wheel distribution (`.whl` file), run the following command:
     ```
     pip install <filename>.whl
     ```

   Replace `<filename>` with the actual name of the downloaded file.

7. Pip will install the `python-dotenv` package and its dependencies from the distribution file located on your USB stick.

Note: Make sure you have a compatible version of Python installed on the computer without an internet connection. Additionally, ensure that any dependencies required by `python-dotenv` are also available on the offline computer or included in the distribution file you downloaded.


pyserial-asyncio
----------------
To install `pyserial-asyncio` offline, you will need to download the necessary files and dependencies on a machine with an internet connection and transfer them to the target machine.

Here's a step-by-step guide to installing `pyserial-asyncio` offline:

1. On a machine with internet access, open a web browser and go to the Python Package Index (PyPI) page for `pyserial-asyncio`: [https://pypi.org/project/pyserial-asyncio/](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial-asyncio/).

2. Scroll down to the "Download files" section and download the source distribution (`.tar.gz` file) for the desired version of `pyserial-asyncio`.

3. Transfer the downloaded file to the offline machine, using a USB drive, network transfer, or any other method you prefer.

4. On the offline machine, ensure that Python is installed. You can check by running `python --version` in a command prompt or terminal.

5. Open a command prompt or terminal on the offline machine and navigate to the directory where you transferred the `pyserial-asyncio` source distribution.

6. Extract the source distribution by running the following command, replacing `pyserial-asyncio-x.x.x.tar.gz` with the actual filename you downloaded:

   ```shell
   tar -xf pyserial-asyncio-x.x.x.tar.gz
   ```

7. Navigate into the extracted directory:

   ```shell
   cd pyserial-asyncio-x.x.x
   ```

8. Now, you need to install the dependencies required by `pyserial-asyncio`. If you know the dependencies in advance, you can download their source distributions from PyPI and transfer them to the offline machine. Otherwise, you can use the `pip` tool to generate a requirements file that lists all the dependencies. On a machine with internet access, run the following command:

   ```shell
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

9. Transfer the `requirements.txt` file to the offline machine.

10. On the offline machine, in the `pyserial-asyncio-x.x.x` directory, run the following command to install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

11. Finally, you can install `pyserial-asyncio` itself by running the following command:

    ```shell
    python setup.py install
    ```

   This will build and install `pyserial-asyncio` on your offline machine.

After following these steps, `pyserial-asyncio` should be installed and ready to use on your offline machine. Keep in mind that if you encounter any issues during the installation, you may need to investigate and resolve any missing dependencies or compatibility problems manually.
